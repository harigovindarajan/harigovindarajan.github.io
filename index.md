## QA Leader and Builder

I lead quality engineering with an AI-first mindset, helping teams move faster without trading off release confidence.

## What I Focus On

- Playwright, API, and mobile automation architecture.
- AI-assisted test design, generation, and maintenance.
- AI-assisted test engineering with Claude Code + Cursor for scaffolding, flaky-test triage, and faster suite maintenance.
- Coaching teams on scalable quality practices.

## Current Priorities

- Shipping production-ready AI-assisted testing workflows.
- Improving flaky-test detection and fix loops.
- Expanding platform-level quality observability.
